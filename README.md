# RISC-V Assembler
Assembler and Simulator for the 4-bit K2 Microprocessor implemented in C.
This project includes:

An Assembler that converts K2 ISA assembly programs into machine code (.bin).

A Simulator that executes machine code on a modelled K2 microprocessor architecture.

Support for fundamental instructions such as arithmetic operations, register transfers, immediate loads, and conditional/unconditional jumps.

Example program: Fibonacci sequence generator written in K2 assembly.

Includes a Makefile for easy compilation and execution.

This project was developed to gain hands-on experience with:

Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) design

Microprocessor simulation in C

Bare-metal programming concepts

Fundamentals of computer architecture
